Wandering through the graveyard it felt like something was watching me. The dawn is slowly bringing sunlight to the world, while I feel the darkness surrounding me grows thicker and stronger.

As I kept walking in, the sunlight became weaker and weaker, and the feeling of being watched by something became more and more obvious. It seems that there is an unusual creature in this cemetery.
