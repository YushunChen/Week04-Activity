Wandering through the graveyard it felt like something was watching me. The dawn is slowly bringing sunlight to the world, while I feel the darkness surrounding me grows thicker and stronger.

As I kept walking in, the sunlight became weaker and weaker, and the feeling of being watched by something became more and more obvious. It seems that there is an unusual creature in this cemetery.

As I continued to walk, the feeling of eyes on me became stronger and stronger. What could be watching me, I thought? And then I suddenly felt anther pair of eyes on me. And then another. As the feeling of eyes multiplied around me, seeming to come from behind every tombstone, the shifting darkness closed in - until all I could see was black.
